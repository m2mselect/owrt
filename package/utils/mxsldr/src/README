Freescale i.MX233/i.MX28 USB loader
===================================

This tool allows user to load U-Boot via BootROM USB download.

Prerequisites:
==============

This tool depends on libusb 1.0, make sure to install development
version of this library.


In case your kernel is very outdated, meaning kernel older than 3.7.4,
3.4.26 (stable) etc. or if your kernel does not properly handle the
MXS BootROM recovery mode, which can be seen in 'dmesg' output by
kernel reporting that the device is ignored due to problem with HID
descriptor, apply patches (*.diff) onto kernel on your host machine
and rebuild the kernel. Then restart the machine with the new kernel.

Usage:
======

1) Connect the MX233/MX28 device to USB via device cable

2) Compile U-Boot and produce u-boot.sb

3) Compile this tool:
 $ make

4) Load u-boot.sb onto the device:
 $ sudo ./mxsldr <path to u-boot.sb>
